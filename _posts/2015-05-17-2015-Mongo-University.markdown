As A web Developer, you have to come to terms that you will not know EVERYTHING and with that i decided to take the
online course from MongoDB University for NodeJS Developers. This course was given for 7 weeks online where Students would listen to a series of videos about using MongoDB to build a blog. the first week was just about getting comfortable with your web dev environment. I used a Mac Book Pro with Atom Text Editor and mongo labs to store my mongo db in the cloud. You can use mongo labs for free they give you a 500MB sandbox in which you can use remotely to get a feel of a remote Database. I picked up the MongoDB Definitive Guide by Kristina Chodorow and MongoDB  Applied Design Patterns by Rick Copeland. Both these books are recommended by the the mongoDB Instructors....


If you are not familiar with MongoDB it is a powerful but easy to get started with. If your coming from a SQL background you will be able to notice the similarities between NoSQL and SQL databases

A Document is the basic unit of data for mongoDB and is roughly equivalent to a row in a relational database (SQL)
Although, I think that Document oriented database is much more expressive. A collection can be thought of as a table with a dynamic schema . A single instance of mongoDB can host multiple independent databases, each which can have its own collections.
                          {% highlight JavaScript  linenos %}    { "Creature" : "Catacomb Sifter" }  {% endhighlight  %}

Every Document has a special key "_id" that is unique within a collection. The most amazing thing about MongoDB comes with a simple but powerful JavaScript shell which is use for the administration of MongoDB instances and data manipulation.

To get started with week 1, I would suggest reading the first few chapters of the MongoDB Definitive Guide in hopes to
wrap your mind around working with mongoDB
