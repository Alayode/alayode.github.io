title: What I learned about learning and procrastination
---

This summer I was placed in the usual position with a client.
We need this type of web application are you interested in working on it?
“sure” have you ever worked in Python Django web applications ” not at all” I said.
Are you willing to learn to develop this software for us. ” I would love to try” I start by designing a simple Static page of the functions that they would like to have and go back and forth until I finally receive the green light to work on the project.
 Working as a Independent contractor can be rough admitting what you can and can’t do sometimes leads you to learn more things about your self then the project itself. This summer I a three month project to develop an web client for a client back-end API.
I choose to use angularJS to build the application and learn a thing or too about how this framework worked. I say this cause it helps me to fight procrastination you know when you have something important to do but you always put it on the “back burner” until you have “time” to work on it ” you know that “Free time” you always tell yourself you will get soon. Learning something brand new is never easy but trying to find ways to make it does. I knew that my client wanted something that wasn’t very polish but to show what I can do for them ultimately. So I took this opportunity to build something in AngularJS a simple XHR web app for their back-end Api. For me procrastination is usually suppressed when there is pressure for me. Luckily Angular wasn’t so difficult to catch up on and I was able to build several modules where angular really shined. I followed simple small steps and worked through each one until the task was completed.
As long as I learned something new about the project and new I was heading in the right direction it made the problem less painful and ultimately easy to finish. As a web developer who is self employed I find these accomplishments very satisfying.
