 As a web developer there are specific hardware and software needs that are required to do the job. And then there is my needs.
 I like to use the latest tech that will make my long hours in front of a screen to be a pleasant one. As much  time as I spent
 in front of a window laptop . My current setup is a Mac Book Pro 15 Retina Display. It is currently running Yosemite and has 8GB of
 RAM 2.3Ghz processor Intel Core i7 a Nvida GeForce GT graphics card. Storage is a 200GB of flash memory.
 This laptop also has a seperate Bootcamp install of Windows 8.1 that I have to use sometimes when i need to check
 webpages and templates in IE. Yes, I am well aware of the huge amounts of emulation software that will allow you to create and instance of
 IE xx Version but for some reason I prefer to use the actual application the one that my audience would be using just in case. Besides those
 virtual browsing software isnt cheap. Moving on as my keyboard I use the Das Keyboard Model S with MX brown switches. These switches allows you to have the
 feel of a mechanical keyboard without the loud clicky noise that comes with the blue switches .

 For my screen setup i am using a AOC 21 inch monitor and a Dell 23 inch monitor. I do plan to upgrade these monitors once
 I find a good deal on them as well as the docking station for them to both work.

 For software I am using a wide range of applications.

 <h3>The Command Line</h3>

 One of the basic tools for every programmers toolbox. I was not a big fan of using the command line since
 it was very intimidating since my days in playing DOS games such as Wolfenstein 3d and Doom :) . for my mac
 setup I use iTERM it is really good adds some extra functionality such as using split Panes HotKey windows , searcj
 Autocomplete and mouseless copy just to name a few.


 <h3>Adobe Creative Cloud</h3>

 This is the ultimate package for any designer/developer first you only pay a monthly fee and you can quickly
 install severeal applications in minutes. Very useful not to mention the cloud storage and website hosting that
 can be use for a small portfolio.

  <h3> WebStorm IDE </h3>

 Since 2013 I started using webstorm because of all the hype it was in using it with angular and node.js applications
 before tha I was using sublime text with eclipse to checkout/commit projects . The one thing I do not like about Webstorm
 is the price unless you are a student you can get this IDE for about the price of free otherwise your shelling out 30-100 bucks

 <h3> Firebug </h3>


This simple tool lets you  find HTML element buried deep within the page, view source code lol and see all of
your highlighted changes it is also a great debugger tool. Chrome, IE, Opera have their versions as well but i prefer to debug
non browser dependent issues in Firefox
