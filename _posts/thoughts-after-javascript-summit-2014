This past week my company was able to get a online invite to the Javascript Summit an online event where
Javascript Developers ,web designers alike get together and talk about the latest topics in the Javascript
world. Some of the talks I was interested in were: Kyle Simpson , Pam Selle, Kitt Hodsden, and one of my favorite
Sahat Yalkabov for his talk on creating a tv Tracker with angularjs,nodejs, and mongoDB. These talks along withmany other angular experts
span over a course of three days all online. Each talk went into depth about similar areas in web development world.
There were many other talks but i was only able to view so many and retain so much. The people i brought up in this blog entry
were the ones that I really enjoyed.

Salhat Yalkabov - Creating a TV Show Tracker using AngularJS, Node.js, and MongoDB

This Developer seems to follow a path very close to own right after graduating from College he started to take on opportunities
to learn more about Javascript developing in frameworks such as angularjs, reactjs, and only using pure JS and not using jQuery.
this was very inspriing for me cause i want to learn about creating a NoSQL SPA application just cause I think it is rather easy to understand and
would work well if your developing quick apps on your own.


I sat in on the Talk in the meeting room at work and listen along to this slides and forked the repo, made the npm installs and ran mongo ,node all in the
webStorm to check out the app. The app is very well maintained it does so much all within one language. It was rather difficult to put the project together
from scratch since all the dependencies were added in an order  you kinda had to patch it together on your own and make sure you knew enough about running mongoDB and node before it would
work.

I would recommend spending a couple of hours on learning more about the MEAN stack and how it is use to create single page applications .It took me a couple of weeks to
get this application up and running and I would say if your persistent you can be successful as well in developing SPW apps./
