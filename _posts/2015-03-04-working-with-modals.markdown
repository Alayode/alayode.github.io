Hey team, I am back with another discussion about FrontEnd Development. I wanted to talk more about working with HTML and CSS.
working within your web pages you may come to need to add functionality for specific information. This type of content is created
usually to notify a user of an event or ask a user to confirm some selection before continuing. This is called the modal Window it can open onto
of your page typically in the center of the page allowing some feature to be viewed before moving on.


Modal Window script are commonly available to be used with in your website with third party libraries such as:
